    "## Key Business Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Revenue Concentration Risk\n",
    "- A small number of products (A-segment) contribute the majority of total net sales.\n",
    "- XA and YA products are critical revenue drivers.\n",
    "- Loss or disruption of these products poses significant business risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Demand vs Inventory Mismatch\n",
    "- Inventory levels remained high even during periods of declining demand.\n",
    "- Several products show inventory coverage far exceeding actual demand.\n",
    "- This indicates overstocking and inefficient inventory planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Shipping Performance Issues\n",
    "- Late shipment rates remained consistently high across shipping modes.\n",
    "- Fast shipping options (e.g., First Class, Same Day) frequently failed to meet delivery promises.\n",
    "- Shipping delays are systemic rather than region-specific.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Volatile Low-Value Products\n",
    "- Z-segment products exhibit highly unstable demand.\n",
    "- These products contribute limited revenue but increase operational complexity.\n"

    "## Data-Driven Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Prioritize Core Products (XA, YA)\n",
    "- Secure alternative suppliers for high-value products.\n",
    "- Maintain higher service levels and safety stock for these segments.\n",
    "- Monitor supplier performance closely to prevent future disruptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Optimize Inventory Levels\n",
    "- Reduce inventory for low-value and volatile segments (Z-products).\n",
    "- Use inventory coverage ratios to define reorder points.\n",
    "- Avoid overstocking products with weak or irregular demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Improve Shipping Reliability\n",
    "- Review and redesign shipping processes for fast delivery modes.\n",
    "- Align promised delivery times with actual logistics capabilities.\n",
    "- Consider regional warehouses or third-party logistics partners.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Implement Demand Forecasting\n",
    "- Use historical order data to forecast demand at product-segment level.\n",
    "- Apply different forecasting strategies for X, Y, and Z demand types.\n"
